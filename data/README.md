# data

This directory contains (1) preprocessed transcripts for the Artie Bias Corpus, in addition to (2) the Artie Bias Corpus datasheet.

The transcripts in `artie-bias-corpus.tsv` have undergone two formatting changes compared to the original transcripts supplied in Common Voice:

1. Numbers written as digits was replaced with the text version, after a human listened to each clip
2. UK English spellings were replaced with American spellings for consistency (e.g. metre --> meter, colour --> color)

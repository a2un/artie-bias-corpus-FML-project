# Artie Bias Corpus

This repo includes transcrtipts and tools for the Artie Bias Corpus. The intended use of both the code and the data is to detect demographic bias in speech technology systems. You can find more information in the blog post [[1](https://www.artie.com/blog/the-artie-bias-corpus)] or the academic publication [[2](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2020/pdf/2020.lrec-1.796.pdf)].

### Requirements

You need three things to use this code:

1. Your ASR model's predictions on the audio of the Artie Bias Corpus.
2. The `artie-bias-corpus.tsv` file of ground-truth transcriptions.
3. The `detect_bias.py` script.


### What is Possible with this Code

1. Detect bias in a single model between two demographic groups.
2. Compare two models in their performance on a single demographic group.


## How to Run the Code

We recommend using a virtual environment to make life easier.

```
$ python3 -m venv artie
$ source artie/bin/activate
(artie) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Once you have the proper environment, you can perform the following two analyses on any models and demographics in the corpus:

1. Finding bias in a single model (male vs female):

```
(artie) $ python detect_bias.py "data/artie-bias-corpus.tsv" "model_A_predictions.tsv" "male,female"
```

2. Finding difference between two models (for female voices):

```
(artie) $ python detect_bias.py "data/artie-bias-corpus.tsv" "model_A_predictions.tsv,model_B_predictions.tsv" "female"
```


## Your Model Predictions Format

When you provide the predictions of your model(s) on the Artie Bias Corpus, those files should be two-columns and contain Tab Separated Values (TSV). The header for the first column should be `"path"` and the header for the second column should be `"prediction"`. Take a look at the included predictions in the `predictions` directory for an example.

```
$ head model_A_predictions.tsv
path	prediction
common_voice_en_18421078.wav	it amazing she said drinking me in and more
common_voice_en_12197.wav	a very company we for man and woman posing rounded the bay several of her women
common_voice_en_673730.wav	basketball player in blue is attempting to block a player in white during the game
common_voice_en_606947.wav	a buried man in green coat tails into the camera is
common_voice_en_648457.wav	a bird is birth or line of some sort attached to pull
common_voice_en_675200.wav	the gratification and atone
common_voice_en_221209.wav	a blond girl posed for a picture at carry park in that
common_voice_en_479225.wav	a boy or two as parlors
common_voice_en_191986.wav	a boy is hanging on monkey bears
```

### Verifying your setup

To test your setup, run the `test.sh` script from within the `misc` directory.

```
misc$ ./test.sh
```

If you see only `PASS` you're OK. If you see some `FAIL`s, you will need to dig into the `test.sh` script identify the problem.


# How we made the Artie Bias Corpus 

We took two main steps to create the ABC. First we filtered data of interest from Common Voice. Second, we re-validated the data.

## Filtering Common Voice 

- Download and extract the Common Voice release / language of interest.
- Identify the `test.tsv`.
- Filter only utterances with `age` OR `gender` OR `accent`.
- Replace blank entries with `NA` (because `pandas`).

## Artie Validation

- Annotators were trained using the validation criteria found in `misc/VALIDATION_CRITERIA.md`.
- The subset of clips resulting from the previous step was validated via a fork of the Common Voice web-app.
- Clips receiving less than two out of three upvotes were discarded from the corpus.

Additionally, we removed 24 clips given other concerns. 22 clips were removed based on concerns that the speakers were not over 18 years old. 1 clip was removed because the user sang the sentence, and 1 clip was removed for problematic content of the text.

### Total number of Clips
```
1712 utterances
970 speakers

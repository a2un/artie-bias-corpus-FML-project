# Artie Bias Corpus + Tools

This repo includes processed transcrtipts and tools for the Artie Bias Corpus. You can download the audio and original transcripts of the corpus here [[0](http://ml-corpora.artie.com/artie-bias-corpus.tar.gz)]. The intended use of both the code and the data is to detect demographic bias in speech technology systems. You can find more information in the blog post [[1](https://www.artie.com/blog/the-artie-bias-corpus)] or the academic publication [[2](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2020/pdf/2020.lrec-1.796.pdf)].

## Datasheet

You may find the Artie Bias Corpus Datasheet in the `data/` directory. Please review before use.


# Using the Tools

You can use the corpus and these tools to perform one of two tasks:

1. Detect bias in a single model between two demographic groups.
2. Compare two models in their performance on a single demographic group.

## Requirements

You need three things to use this code:

1. Your ASR model's predictions on the audio of the Artie Bias Corpus.
2. The `artie-bias-corpus.tsv` file of ground-truth transcriptions.
3. The `detect_bias.py` script.


### Your Model Predictions Format

When you provide the predictions of your model(s) on the Artie Bias Corpus, those files should be two-columns and contain Tab Separated Values (TSV). The header for the first column should be `"path"` and the header for the second column should be `"prediction"`. Take a look at the included predictions in the `predictions/` directory for an example.

```
$ head your-model-predictions.tsv
path	prediction
common_voice_en_18421078.wav	it amazing she said drinking me in and more
common_voice_en_12197.wav	a very company we for man and woman posing rounded the bay several of her women
common_voice_en_673730.wav	basketball player in blue is attempting to block a player in white during the game
```

## Setup

We recommend using a virtual environment to make life easier.

```
$ python3 -m venv artie
$ source artie/bin/activate
(artie) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Verifying your setup

To test your setup, run the `test.sh` script from within the `misc` directory.

```
misc$ ./test.sh
```

If you see only `PASS` you're OK. If you see some `FAIL`s, you will need to dig into the `test.sh` script identify the problem.


## Usage

Once you have the proper environment, you can perform the following two analyses on any models and demographics in the corpus:

1. Finding bias in a single model (male vs female):

```
(artie) $ python detect_bias.py "data/artie-bias-corpus.tsv" "model_A_predictions.tsv" "male,female"
```

2. Finding difference between two models (for female voices):

```
(artie) $ python detect_bias.py "data/artie-bias-corpus.tsv" "model_A_predictions.tsv,model_B_predictions.tsv" "female"
```


# Creating the Artie Bias Corpus 

We took two main steps to create the Artie Bias Corpus. First we filtered data of interest from Common Voice. Second, we re-validated the data. You can find more details in the blog post [[1](https://www.artie.com/blog/the-artie-bias-corpus)] or the academic publication [[2](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2020/pdf/2020.lrec-1.796.pdf)].

## Filtering Common Voice 

- Download and extract the Common Voice release / language of interest.
- Identify the `test.tsv`.
- Filter only utterances with `age` OR `gender` OR `accent`.
- Replace blank entries with `NA` (because `pandas`).

## Artie Validation

- Annotators were trained using the validation criteria found in `misc/VALIDATION_CRITERIA.md`.
- The subset of clips resulting from the previous step was validated via a fork of the Common Voice web-app.
- Clips receiving less than two out of three upvotes were discarded from the corpus.

Additionally, we removed 24 clips given other concerns. 22 clips were removed based on concerns that the speakers were not over 18 years old. 1 clip was removed because the user sang the sentence, and 1 clip was removed for problematic content of the text.

## Artie Bias Corpus Format

You should use the provided `artie-bias-corpus.tsv` file provided in this repo. It has the following column structure:

```
